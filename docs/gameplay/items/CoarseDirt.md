# Coarse Dirt

**Coarse Dirt** (`minecraft:coarse_dirt`) is a terrain block item. The [Soil, Sand, and Gravel guide](../blocks/SoilSandAndGravel.md) covers its placed behavior, support, conversions, and collection. [Item registration][registration] · [Block registration][block-registration]

## Collecting and moving it

Mine a Coarse Dirt block with any tool or by hand to receive **1 Coarse Dirt**. Its loot does not require Silk Touch. [Block loot][loot]

A shovel is the efficient mining tool. No tool material tier is required for this block’s ordinary loot. [Mining tag][shovel-tag] · [Player harvest gate][player]

## Placed uses

[Craft 4 Coarse Dirt from 2 Dirt and 2 Gravel](../blocks/SoilSandAndGravel.md#coarse-dirt-recipe). Grass and Mycelium do not spread directly onto it. A hoe turns it into Dirt first; a shovel can make a Path and a water bottle can make Mud.

Follow the shared guide for the exact conditions and recipe sources. [Soil, Sand, and Gravel](../blocks/SoilSandAndGravel.md) · [Blocks](../blocks/Blocks.md) · [Items](Items.md)
