# Yellow Carpet

**Yellow Carpet** (`minecraft:yellow_carpet`) is a thin yellow floor covering made from wool. Its placement, support, mining, fire, fuel, and vibration rules are in the [Wool and Carpet guide](../blocks/WoolAndCarpet.md). [Block registration][blocks] · [Item registration][items]

## Crafting

Place **two [Yellow Wool](YellowWool.md) side by side in one row** to make **three yellow carpets**. Both wool inputs must be yellow; mixing wool colors does not match this recipe. [Recipe][craft]

To recolor an existing carpet, combine **one [Yellow Dye](YellowDye.md)** with **one wool carpet of any other bundled color**, shapeless, to make **one yellow carpet**. All 15 other wool-carpet colors are accepted; yellow carpet, [Moss Carpet](MossCarpet.md), and [Pale Moss Carpet](PaleMossCarpet.md) are not inputs. [Recoloring recipe][dye]

## Collection and use

Breaking placed yellow carpet normally returns **one yellow carpet**, not wool. There is no Silk Touch requirement; its loot has an explosion-survival condition. [Block loot][loot]

Place it above a supporting block and keep it away from fire. See [placement and support](../blocks/WoolAndCarpet.md#placement-and-support) before removing the floor beneath it, and [vibrations](../blocks/WoolAndCarpet.md#vibrations) before relying on carpet around sculk.
