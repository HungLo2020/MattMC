# Sand

**Sand** (`minecraft:sand`) is a terrain block item. The [Soil, Sand, and Gravel guide](../blocks/SoilSandAndGravel.md) covers its placed behavior, support, conversions, and collection. [Item registration][registration] · [Block registration][block-registration]

## Collecting and moving it

Mine an ordinary Sand block with any tool or by hand to receive **1 Sand**. Silk Touch and Fortune do not change its ordinary loot. [Block loot][loot]

A shovel is the efficient mining tool. No tool material tier is required for this block’s ordinary loot. [Mining tag][shovel-tag] · [Player harvest gate][player]

## Placed uses

Sand follows the [falling and landing rules](../blocks/SoilSandAndGravel.md#sand-red-sand-and-gravel-falling). Its selected uses include [Sandstone crafting](../blocks/SoilSandAndGravel.md#selected-material-recipes), [Glass smelting](Glass.md#obtaining), and [Concrete Powder](../blocks/Concrete.md).
