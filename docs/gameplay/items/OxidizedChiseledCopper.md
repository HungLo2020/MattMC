# Oxidized Chiseled Copper

Oxidized Chiseled Copper is a **fully oxidized, unwaxed decorative full block in the chiseled copper family**. See [Copper construction](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#full-blocks) for its placed-block properties.

## Obtaining

Place **2 [Oxidized Cut Copper Slab](OxidizedCutCopperSlab.md) vertically → 1 Oxidized Chiseled Copper**. This fits the inventory crafting grid. [Slab recipe][recipe-craft]

At a [Stonecutter](../blocks/Stonecutter.md), **1 [Oxidized Copper](OxidizedCopper.md) → 4 Oxidized Chiseled Copper**, or **1 [Oxidized Cut Copper](OxidizedCutCopper.md) → 1 Oxidized Chiseled Copper**. Choose the full copper input when making these blocks in bulk. [Full-block input][recipe-stone-full] · [Cut input][recipe-stone-cut]

Remove the wax from a placed [Waxed Oxidized Chiseled Copper](WaxedOxidizedChiseledCopper.md) with an unbroken axe. Aging a placed [Weathered Chiseled Copper](WeatheredChiseledCopper.md) also reaches this variant. Collect the resulting block after the conversion. [Axe conversions][axe] · [Stage map][weather]

Mine the matching placed block with an **unbroken Stone, Copper, Iron, Diamond, or Netherite Pickaxe** to recover **1 Oxidized Chiseled Copper**. Wooden and Golden Pickaxes do not satisfy its drop requirement. See [mining and collection](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#mining-and-collection) for the shared tool and explosion rules.

## Usage

Place it for a chiseled finish in [full-block construction](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#full-blocks). The bundled recipes do not turn Chiseled Copper back into Cut Copper, slabs, plain full copper blocks, or ingots.

## Behavior

This is the last oxidation stage, so it does not age further. Use Honeycomb to preserve this stage as [Waxed Oxidized Chiseled Copper](WaxedOxidizedChiseledCopper.md). [Aging callback][aging] · [Matching wax recipe][matching-wax-recipe]

Use the shared [oxidation and spacing](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#oxidation-and-spacing), [waxing and scraping](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#waxing-and-scraping), and [lightning-cleaning rules](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#lightning-cleaning) when managing the finish.
