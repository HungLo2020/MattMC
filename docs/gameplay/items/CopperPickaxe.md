# Copper Pickaxe

**Copper Pickaxe** (`minecraft:copper_pickaxe`) has **190 durability** and a **5.0 matching-block mining-speed value** before player modifiers. See [Pickaxes and Shovels](../mechanics/PickaxesAndShovels.md) for its shared actions, wear, and collection rules. [Registration][registration] · [Material properties][materials]

## Obtaining

At a [Crafting Table](../blocks/CraftingTable.md), use **3 Copper Ingots** across the top row and **2 [Sticks](Stick.md)** down the middle beneath them. This makes **1 Copper Pickaxe**. [Recipe][recipe] · [Accepted head materials][repair-copper]

## Mining and upkeep

It meets the material requirement for Iron and Copper Ore, but its material denies drops from Iron- and Diamond-requirement blocks, including Diamond Ore and Obsidian. See [Mining tiers](../mechanics/Mining.md#tier-restrictions) and [Ore resources](../blocks/OreResources.md). [Material exclusion tag][deny-copper] · [Pickaxe targets][pickaxe-tag] · [Drop rules][tool]

For [Anvil material repair](../mechanics/Durability.md#choose-a-repair-method), use [Copper Ingot](CopperIngot.md). Ordinary wear retains a fully damaged stack; repair it before relying on its mining speed and correct-tool drops.

An unwanted tool can also be processed through the [verified nugget-recycling recipes](../mechanics/PickaxesAndShovels.md#recycling-and-fuel).
