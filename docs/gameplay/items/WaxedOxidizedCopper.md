# Waxed Oxidized Copper

Waxed Oxidized Copper is a **fully oxidized, waxed full copper building block and a source material for matching copper construction pieces**. See [Copper construction](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#full-blocks) for its placed-block properties.

## Obtaining

Combine **1 [Oxidized Copper](OxidizedCopper.md) + 1 [Honeycomb](Honeycomb.md) → 1 Waxed Oxidized Copper** in any crafting-grid positions. You can also apply one Honeycomb to the matching placed unwaxed block and then collect it. [Waxing recipe][recipe-wax] · [Placed waxing][wax]

Mine the matching placed block with an **unbroken Stone, Copper, Iron, Diamond, or Netherite Pickaxe** to recover **1 Waxed Oxidized Copper**. Wooden and Golden Pickaxes do not satisfy its drop requirement. See [mining and collection](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#mining-and-collection) for the shared tool and explosion rules. [This variant’s loot][loot]

## Usage

Each block can be stonecut into **4 [Waxed Oxidized Cut Copper](WaxedOxidizedCutCopper.md)**, **4 [Waxed Oxidized Chiseled Copper](WaxedOxidizedChiseledCopper.md)**, **4 [Waxed Oxidized Copper Grate](WaxedOxidizedCopperGrate.md)**, **8 [Waxed Oxidized Cut Copper Slab](WaxedOxidizedCutCopperSlab.md)**, or **4 [Waxed Oxidized Cut Copper Stairs](WaxedOxidizedCutCopperStairs.md)**, keeping its stage and wax state. [Cut recipe][use-cut] · [Chiseled recipe][use-chiseled] · [Grates recipe][use-grates] · [Slabs recipe][use-slabs] · [Stairs recipe][use-stairs]

This aged block has **no direct recipe into Copper Ingots**. To recover the metal, place it, remove its wax and then scrape it back 3 stages to [Block of Copper](BlockOfCopper.md), then mine and unpack that block. See [wax removal and scraping](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#waxing-and-scraping).

It also works as the full copper body for [creating a Copper Golem and Copper Chest](../blocks/CopperChests.md#creating-a-chest-with-a-copper-golem); place the carved pumpkin head last. [Construction pattern][golem]

## Behavior

Wax keeps this finish from aging. One use of an unbroken axe removes the wax and leaves [Oxidized Copper](OxidizedCopper.md), **without changing its oxidation stage**. [Wax/axe conversion][axe]

Use the shared [oxidation and spacing](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#oxidation-and-spacing), [waxing and scraping](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#waxing-and-scraping), and [lightning-cleaning rules](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#lightning-cleaning) when managing the finish.
