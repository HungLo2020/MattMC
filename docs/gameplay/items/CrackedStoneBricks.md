# Cracked Stone Bricks

## Obtaining

In a [Furnace](../blocks/Furnace.md), smelt **1 [Stone Bricks](StoneBricks.md) → 1 Cracked Stone Bricks** with fuel. Each item takes **200 game ticks**, nominally **10 seconds at 20 ticks per second**, and specifies **0.1 recipe experience**. Use regular Stone Bricks for this recipe. The Furnace guide explains fuel and experience collection. [Recipe 1]

Mine with an **unbroken pickaxe**, including a Wooden Pickaxe: each block returns **1 Cracked Stone Bricks**. Breaking it by hand does not collect it. Silk Touch does not change the output or bypass the pickaxe requirement, and Fortune does not multiply it. [Drop table] · [Pickaxe tag] · [Tool gate] · [Broken tools] See the [family mining rules](../blocks/Stone.md#obtaining) for tool tiers and drop conditions. [Wood tier]

## Usage

Use Cracked Stone Bricks as a worn full-block finish, for example mixed into a Stone Bricks wall or ruin. There are no registered Cracked Stone Brick slabs, stairs or walls in this family; use the ordinary [Stone Brick shapes](../blocks/Stone.md#stairs-slabs-and-walls) where a shaped block is needed. [Registered blocks]

## Behavior

This is an ordinary full masonry block. For placed-block properties and the distinction from [Infested lookalikes](../blocks/Stone.md#infested-stone-variants), see the [Stone block guide](../blocks/Stone.md#block-properties). The mining route above returns this ordinary item. [Block registration] · [Drop table]

Find Cracked Stone Bricks by name in the combined [inventory item browser](../mechanics/InventoryBrowser.md). Its catalog entry is available to browse, but requesting an item requires the server's infinite-materials ability, normally Creative mode; ordinary Survival browsing does not supply it.
