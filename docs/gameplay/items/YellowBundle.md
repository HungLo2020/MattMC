# Yellow Bundle

**Yellow Bundle** (`minecraft:yellow_bundle`) is the yellow variant of the [Bundle](Bundle.md). It stacks to one and uses the shared Bundle controls and capacity. [Registration][yellow-item]

## Obtaining

Put **one Bundle and one [Yellow Dye](YellowDye.md)** in any two crafting-grid slots to make **one Yellow Bundle**. You can use an uncolored Bundle or another color, with contents still inside. The recipe accepts the full Bundle item tag; it copies the input's stored items and other saved components. An already yellow Bundle combined with Yellow Dye produces no result.

Get the first uncolored Bundle through [its crafting and village-loot routes](Bundle.md#obtaining). Yellow Bundle is also directly listed in the ordinary [Inventory Browser](../mechanics/InventoryBrowser.md), visible in **Survival and Creative**; insertion requires **Creative**. [Category entries][category] · [Browser list][browser] · [Server access][browser-server]

## Usage

Use the [inventory controls](Bundle.md#inventory-controls) to insert or take stored stacks, and [scroll over the Bundle](Bundle.md#selecting-a-stored-stack) to choose a shown stack. Holding Use in the world [drops its stored stacks](Bundle.md#emptying-in-the-world).

## Behavior

Use the color to distinguish supplies; Yellow Bundle has the same storage capacity as every other Bundle color. [Registration][yellow-item]

The [capacity rules](Bundle.md#capacity) depend on each stored item's maximum stack size. [Nesting rules](Bundle.md#nested-bundles-and-blocked-items) allow another Bundle with an added space cost and exclude Shulker Boxes. Recoloring this Bundle with a different dye keeps its contents; see the [full color list](Bundle.md#colors-and-recoloring).
