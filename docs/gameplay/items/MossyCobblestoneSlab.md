# Mossy Cobblestone Slab

## Obtaining

At a [Crafting Table](../blocks/CraftingTable.md), craft **3 [Mossy Cobblestone](MossyCobblestone.md) across one row → 6 Mossy Cobblestone Slab**. [Recipe]

At a [Stonecutter](../blocks/Stonecutter.md), **1 [Mossy Cobblestone](MossyCobblestone.md) → 2 Mossy Cobblestone Slab**. [Stonecutting 1]

Make the matching mossy full block first; the shape recipe does not accept the plain block with moss added beside it. See [mossy-material recipes](../blocks/Stone.md#mossy-variants). [Recipe]

Mine with an **unbroken pickaxe**, including a Wooden Pickaxe: a single slab returns **1 Mossy Cobblestone Slab**, and a double slab returns **2**. Breaking it by hand does not collect it. Silk Touch does not change the output or bypass the pickaxe requirement, and Fortune does not multiply it. [Drop table] · [Pickaxe tag] · [Tool gate] · [Broken tools] See the [family mining rules](../blocks/Stone.md#obtaining) for tool tiers and drop conditions. [Wood tier]

## Usage

Use Mossy Cobblestone Slab for half-height floors, paths, roofs and detailing.

## Behavior

Two **Mossy Cobblestone Slab** items can combine into a matching double slab; this stays a slab block and mines back into two slabs. Single slabs occupy the upper or lower half of a block space and can be waterlogged; double slabs cannot. [Slab placement] See the [placed-shape guide](../blocks/Stone.md#placing-shaped-blocks) for placement details.

Find Mossy Cobblestone Slab by name in the combined [inventory item browser](../mechanics/InventoryBrowser.md). Its catalog entry is available to browse, but requesting an item requires the server's infinite-materials ability, normally Creative mode; ordinary Survival browsing does not supply it.
