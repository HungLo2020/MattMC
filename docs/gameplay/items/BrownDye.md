# Brown Dye

**Brown Dye** (`minecraft:brown_dye`). Cocoa Beans turn directly into Brown Dye. The bean recipe uses one item and returns one dye. [Registration]

## Obtaining

| Ingredients for one operation | Dye output | Method and source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** [Cocoa Beans](CocoaBeans.md) | **1** | Shapeless crafting · [Recipe 1] |

The crafting rows are shapeless: put one ingredient in each occupied slot, with no fixed arrangement, then take the result. [Shapeless matching] · [Crafting and consumption]

The [Cocoa guide](../blocks/Cocoa.md) owns planting, support, growth and bean harvesting. Reserve beans for replanting before converting the rest.

This color is also listed in the ordinary [inventory item browser](../mechanics/InventoryBrowser.md), available in Survival and Creative. For the selected Wandering Trader offer and shared acquisition notes, see [Dyes](Dyes.md#browser-and-trading). [Ordinary dye entries]

## Usage

For a brown building or storage palette, start with [Brown Wool](BrownWool.md), [Brown Carpet](BrownCarpet.md), or a [Brown Bundle](BrownBundle.md). Each output page owns its permitted inputs and recipe.

For [Sheep fleece, pet collars, sign text and other applications](Dyes.md#choosing-how-to-apply-a-dye), use the shared Dyes guide. [Wool and Carpet](../blocks/WoolAndCarpet.md) explains material recoloring and [Signs](../blocks/Signs.md#dye-glow-ink-and-wax) explains text decoration.

## Behavior

The recipe consumes **Cocoa Beans**, not a planted Cocoa block. Harvest beans before placing them in the crafting grid.
