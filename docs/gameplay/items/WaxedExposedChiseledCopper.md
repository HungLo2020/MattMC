# Waxed Exposed Chiseled Copper

Waxed Exposed Chiseled Copper is an **exposed, waxed decorative full block in the chiseled copper family**. See [Copper construction](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#full-blocks) for its placed-block properties.

## Obtaining

Place **2 [Waxed Exposed Cut Copper Slab](WaxedExposedCutCopperSlab.md) vertically → 1 Waxed Exposed Chiseled Copper**. This fits the inventory crafting grid. [Slab recipe][recipe-craft]

At a [Stonecutter](../blocks/Stonecutter.md), **1 [Waxed Exposed Copper](WaxedExposedCopper.md) → 4 Waxed Exposed Chiseled Copper**, or **1 [Waxed Exposed Cut Copper](WaxedExposedCutCopper.md) → 1 Waxed Exposed Chiseled Copper**. Choose the full copper input when making these blocks in bulk. [Full-block input][recipe-stone-full] · [Cut input][recipe-stone-cut]

Combine **1 [Exposed Chiseled Copper](ExposedChiseledCopper.md) + 1 [Honeycomb](Honeycomb.md) → 1 Waxed Exposed Chiseled Copper** in any crafting-grid positions. You can also apply one Honeycomb to the matching placed unwaxed block and then collect it. [Waxing recipe][recipe-wax] · [Placed waxing][wax]

Mine the matching placed block with an **unbroken Stone, Copper, Iron, Diamond, or Netherite Pickaxe** to recover **1 Waxed Exposed Chiseled Copper**. Wooden and Golden Pickaxes do not satisfy its drop requirement. See [mining and collection](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#mining-and-collection) for the shared tool and explosion rules.

## Usage

Place it for a chiseled finish in [full-block construction](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#full-blocks). The bundled recipes do not turn Chiseled Copper back into Cut Copper, slabs, plain full copper blocks, or ingots.

## Behavior

Wax keeps this finish from aging. One use of an unbroken axe removes the wax and leaves [Exposed Chiseled Copper](ExposedChiseledCopper.md), **without changing its oxidation stage**. [Wax/axe conversion][axe]

Use the shared [oxidation and spacing](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#oxidation-and-spacing), [waxing and scraping](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#waxing-and-scraping), and [lightning-cleaning rules](../blocks/CopperConstruction.md#lightning-cleaning) when managing the finish.
