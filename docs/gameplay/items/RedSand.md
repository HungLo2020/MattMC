# Red Sand

**Red Sand** (`minecraft:red_sand`) is a terrain block item. The [Soil, Sand, and Gravel guide](../blocks/SoilSandAndGravel.md) covers its placed behavior, support, conversions, and collection. [Item registration][registration] · [Block registration][block-registration]

## Collecting and moving it

Mine Red Sand with any tool or by hand to receive **1 Red Sand**. Silk Touch and Fortune do not change its ordinary loot. [Block loot][loot]

A shovel is the efficient mining tool. No tool material tier is required for this block’s ordinary loot. [Mining tag][shovel-tag] · [Player harvest gate][player]

## Placed uses

It follows the same [falling rules](../blocks/SoilSandAndGravel.md#sand-red-sand-and-gravel-falling) as Sand. It makes [Red Sandstone](../blocks/SoilSandAndGravel.md#selected-material-recipes) and can be [smelted into Glass](Glass.md#obtaining), but the checked Concrete Powder recipes require ordinary Sand.

Follow the shared guide for the exact conditions and recipe sources. [Soil, Sand, and Gravel](../blocks/SoilSandAndGravel.md) · [Blocks](../blocks/Blocks.md) · [Items](Items.md)
