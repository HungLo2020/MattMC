# Netherite Pickaxe

**Netherite Pickaxe** (`minecraft:netherite_pickaxe`) has **2,031 durability** and a **9.0 matching-block mining-speed value** before player modifiers. See [Pickaxes and Shovels](../mechanics/PickaxesAndShovels.md) for its shared actions, wear, and collection rules. [Registration][registration] · [Material properties][materials]

## Obtaining

Use the [Diamond Pickaxe upgrade in the Smithing guide](../smithing/Smithing.md#example-upgrade-a-diamond-pickaxe). The registered transformation returns **1 Netherite Pickaxe** and retains the base tool’s saved changes, including its damage value.

## Mining and upkeep

Its material exclusion tag is empty, so it meets the material-tier check for Obsidian and Ancient Debris. A matching pickaxe-family rule and the block’s loot conditions are still required. See [Mining tiers](../mechanics/Mining.md#tier-restrictions) and [Ore resources](../blocks/OreResources.md). [Material exclusion tag][deny-netherite] · [Pickaxe targets][pickaxe-tag] · [Drop rules][tool]

For [Anvil material repair](../mechanics/Durability.md#choose-a-repair-method), use [Netherite Ingot](NetheriteIngot.md). Ordinary wear retains a fully damaged stack; repair it before relying on its mining speed and correct-tool drops.

Dropped Netherite tools have [fire and lava resistance](../mechanics/PickaxesAndShovels.md#netherite-upgrades) through their item damage-resistance property.
