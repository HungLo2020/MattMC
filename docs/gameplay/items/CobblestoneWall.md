# Cobblestone Wall

## Obtaining

At a [Crafting Table](../blocks/CraftingTable.md), craft **6 [Cobblestone](Cobblestone.md) → 6 Cobblestone Wall**, filling **two complete rows of three**. [Recipe]

At a [Stonecutter](../blocks/Stonecutter.md), **1 [Cobblestone](Cobblestone.md) → 1 Cobblestone Wall**. [Stonecutting 1]

Mine with an **unbroken pickaxe**, including a Wooden Pickaxe: each block returns **1 Cobblestone Wall**. Breaking it by hand does not collect it. Silk Touch does not change the output or bypass the pickaxe requirement, and Fortune does not multiply it. [Drop table] · [Pickaxe tag] · [Tool gate] · [Broken tools] See the [family mining rules](../blocks/Stone.md#obtaining) for tool tiers and drop conditions. [Wood tier]

## Usage

Use Cobblestone Wall for connected boundary walls, posts and building details.

## Behavior

Walls connect to neighboring walls, suitable sturdy block faces, Iron Bars and suitably aligned Fence Gates. Their collision reaches **1.5 blocks high**, and they can be waterlogged. [Wall shape] See the [placed-shape guide](../blocks/Stone.md#placing-shaped-blocks) for connection and post behavior.

## Notes

* This item is the item form of the `minecraft:cobblestone_wall` block. [Item registration] · [Block registration]

Find Cobblestone Wall by name in the combined [inventory item browser](../mechanics/InventoryBrowser.md). Its catalog entry is available to browse, but requesting an item requires the server's infinite-materials ability, normally Creative mode; ordinary Survival browsing does not supply it.
