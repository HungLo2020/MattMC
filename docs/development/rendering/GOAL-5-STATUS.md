# Goal 5 rendering checkpoint

**Goal 5 remains incomplete.** The [2026-10-04 renderer follow-up `37817e1`](https://github.com/HungLo2020/MattMC/commit/37817e128b99b07456c0ee22a5d34eaf05c72150) changes 118 paths after the [2026-10-03 checkpoint `2fff1ef`](https://github.com/HungLo2020/MattMC/commit/2fff1ef19106350f806ddedd4fb3c3b4fbc44716), which changed 254 paths. The follow-up repairs specific shader, DH lighting and shutdown cases and reduces measured component costs. Cold terrain readiness, an independent native crash, underground image differences, broad parity and the overall performance objective remain open.

The current migration retains Java configuration, CPU collection and terrain visibility work. Rust consumes copied semantics, and Rust/VulkanicGAL owns native rendering resources, command submission and presentation. The precise current boundaries are documented below; this checkpoint does not claim that every policy has migrated. The final project target is one Rust executable supporting both client and server, at most one separately loaded Rust library, and no Java. See [Project Architecture](../PROJECT-ARCHITECTURE.md) and [Render Architecture](RENDER-ARCHITECTURE.md).

The [current rendering tracker checkpoint](https://github.com/HungLo2020/MattMC/issues/747#issuecomment-5982772544) records the follow-up scope and remaining acceptance work. The [earlier checkpoint](https://github.com/HungLo2020/MattMC/issues/747#issuecomment-5972378509) preserves the `2fff1ef` evidence; neither progress comment closes the remaining work.

## What changed

The earlier `2fff1ef` checkpoint established this scope:

- **Shader sources and inputs:** broader single-color programs, terrain and particle alpha policy, selected custom textures and sampler aliases, typed bounded custom expressions, built-in celestial/light inputs, scoped color/shadow directives, exact R16F, begin/prepare passes, and legacy fullscreen/sky/horizon/celestial transforms. Supported contracts still gate admission; this is not compatibility with every Iris pack. [Implementation](RENDER-ARCHITECTURE.md#shader-controls-at-startup)
- **Entity shadows:** ABI 68 carries immutable entity/leash bounds, camera origin, eligibility and shadow roles for Rust-owned selection. Typed orb ordering survives shadow-only mesh filtering. Rebuild Java and native code together. [Bridge](JAVA-BRIDGE.md) · [Ordering checks](ENTITY-SHADOW-CHECKS.md)
- **DH and terrain:** CPU lifetime leases and selected-column replacement protection, correct snapshot usage through DOUBLE_PASS fading, spectator-in-solid visibility, and fogged vanilla lower-sky geometry. These address separate bounded failure cases. [Resource ownership](RENDER-ARCHITECTURE.md#resource-ownership-and-retries) · [Movement checks](TERRAIN-MOVEMENT-CHECKS.md)
- **Cost and diagnosis:** whole-frame GUI item-cache eviction, packed terrain instances/shared uniforms, earlier shadow selection, reduced hazard bookkeeping allocations, guarded audit formatting, improved timing/resource counters and bounded capture/movement/resize/overlap observers. [GAL](VULKANIC-GAL.md) · [Verification](RENDER-VERIFICATION.md)

Admission remains bounded. The source supports [at most eight color targets](https://github.com/HungLo2020/MattMC/blob/2fff1ef19106350f806ddedd4fb3c3b4fbc44716/src/main/rust/render/shaderpack/resources/color_targets/declarations.rs#L5-L7), and custom properties use the [supported typed expression grammar and functions](RENDER-ARCHITECTURE.md#shader-controls-at-startup), including scalar operations and vector construction. Unsupported active functions remain an admission failure. Selected POM, generated-normal and anisotropic-filter settings retain their [unsupported-feature gates](https://github.com/HungLo2020/MattMC/blob/2fff1ef19106350f806ddedd4fb3c3b4fbc44716/src/main/rust/render/shaderpack/contracts/terrain.rs#L1562-L1583). These boundaries prevent a blanket shader-pack compatibility claim.

### October 4 follow-up

- **Shader inputs and shadows:** source-derived integer texel addresses now use the sampled target's row convention; manifest-free aliases resolve supported Rust-owned images under the actual stage's properties. Empty selected-source frames initialize and retain owned shadow snapshots, rollback retires frontend consumers before runtime images, and terrain shadow casters retain faces omitted from camera color draws. Admission remains bounded. [Shader architecture](RENDER-ARCHITECTURE.md#shader-controls-at-startup) · [Capture inputs](RENDERDOC-INPUTS.md)
- **DH and terrain:** fully opaque leaf colors stay in the opaque DH stream; built-in DH lighting preserves dark skylight rows. The CPU terrain source combines urgent edits, one nearest-section dispatch in four, current portal-frontier work and immediate loaded-air connectivity. These are separate repairs; nearby geometry can still arrive late in cold first-turn observations. [Ownership and dispatch](RENDER-ARCHITECTURE.md#resource-ownership-and-retries) · [Movement checks](TERRAIN-MOVEMENT-CHECKS.md)
- **Costs:** per-pass immutable terrain uniforms, cached complete repeated-mesh plans, bounded foil copies and reduced snapshot/diagnostic allocations avoid measured work. Java retains the CPU producers described in the architecture. The recorded component reductions do not establish an overall FPS gain. [Shader terrain profiling](SHADER-TERRAIN-PROFILING.md)
- **Diagnosis and termination:** completed capture receipts retain exact frame/submission uniforms and attachment extents; absent optional snapshots are marked unavailable. The harness rejects an observed owned-client core dump even when the wrapper exits 143. Best-effort renderer console writes repair a reproduced closed-pipe abort; a separate disconnect SIGSEGV remains unresolved.

## What the recorded evidence establishes

The [earlier progress log](https://github.com/HungLo2020/MattMC/blob/2fff1ef19106350f806ddedd4fb3c3b4fbc44716/PROGRESS.md) and [follow-up progress log](https://github.com/HungLo2020/MattMC/blob/37817e128b99b07456c0ee22a5d34eaf05c72150/PROGRESS.md) contain the implementation author's test and capture results. Those Java, Rust, native and gameplay runs were not rerun by this documentation review; their ignored capture artifacts are not bundled with the wiki. The earlier independent review passed 60 Python rendering-tool tests; the follow-up tracker review passed 79 isolated Python rendering-tool tests at `37817e1`. These verify tooling scope only.

The earlier log records passing scoped Complementary static comparisons, hidden/visible leaf-particle cutout comparisons, first selected-source frames for specific Complementary and MakeUp/DH-off workloads, and bounded DH movement repeats after repairing selected-column asset-ack pruning. It also records before/after observations for spectator terrain and dark-sky-disc fog. These results apply to the documented workloads and keep their original tolerances.

MakeUp's latest listed image pair still exceeds tolerance 6. The older Iris+DH V6 far-extension check remains a failed historical result: its per-channel error is 9.686/15.968/11.238 even though the whole-image average is lower. The later coast results below apply to their own recorded workloads and do not erase that verdict. A clean validation log, completed run, compiled shader or low whole-image average cannot replace the required scoped image comparison.

The follow-up's [recorded coast comparisons](RENDER-VERIFICATION.md#4-performance-ab) pass the unchanged tolerance 6 after the individual fixes: shader-disabled DH has whole-image RGB MAE 0.943/1.205/1.420 and DH-region 2.043/1.587/1.473; the later original-pack Iris+DH capture, after correcting optional-snapshot readback, has whole-image 3.671/4.177/3.852 and DH-region 4.951/5.389/4.726. Opaque leaf crowns and the integer-depth light-shaft path have their own retained before/after evidence. These are settled coast poses, not motion, first-frame, broad parity or resource-bound acceptance.

[Cold first-turn observations](TERRAIN-MOVEMENT-CHECKS.md) still show delayed nearby terrain/water. Correlated diagnostics establish missing regular geometry in one cold frame; diagnostic timing does not measure ordinary presentation latency. Historical sessions rejected by later core-record audits remain rejected. Bounded clean console-fix repeats address the closed-pipe abort only; they do not resolve the independent disconnect SIGSEGV.

The [original-pack underground comparison](UNDERGROUND-SHADER-CHECKS.md) still fails (RGB MAE 20.566/15.041/10.029). Null-depth and disabled-volumetric diagnostic comparisons are causal evidence only. Production fog and light shafts remain enabled, and the underground exception decision remains pending.

[Per-pass preparation measurements](RENDER-VERIFICATION.md#4-performance-ab) record reductions of about 18%, while [repeated-mesh batching measurements](SHADER-TERRAIN-PROFILING.md#repeated-mesh-plans) record reductions of 13–15%. The repeated-mesh Current runs remain about 34–35 FPS against Frozen about 304–308 FPS; varying readiness and live populations limit comparisons. No overall FPS improvement or broad performance acceptance is established.

## Remaining work

- Broad vanilla, DH, Iris and Iris+DH visual and temporal parity, including water, foliage, day/night/weather, entities/layers, hands, GUI and resource packs
- General terrain flicker investigation across all four routes, cold terrain/water readiness and the failed original-pack underground comparison; clean bounded videos do not establish acceptance
- The independent disconnect SIGSEGV, repeated entry/exit and broad native stability; the closed-pipe fix does not close these cases
- First selected-source frames for other packs and real transitions, plus reloads, dimensions, resize/fullscreen and repeated entry/exit
- Matching animated source clocks, repeated performance measurements and long-run/reload/large-radius CPU/GPU resource bounds

Offscreen source preparation helps initialize the selected graph before presentation. The current [admission code](https://github.com/HungLo2020/MattMC/blob/37817e128b99b07456c0ee22a5d34eaf05c72150/src/main/rust/render/worldrender/source/admission.rs#L1538-L1618) still disarms incomplete frame coverage or unavailable DH depth and reports Rust-vanilla fallback. A fallback in a required shader frame is a failed Goal 5 workload, not evidence of selected-pack success. Follow [real-config checks](RENDER-VERIFICATION.md#3-real-config-session), capture stdout and stderr, and check actual presentation correlation.

Entity culling does not add Citadel model geometry transport. The conditional empty-model limitation tracked in [#803](https://github.com/HungLo2020/MattMC/issues/803) remains applicable; avoid converting source warnings into either universal crash claims or a declaration that imported mobs now render correctly.

For source-input investigations use [RenderDoc observations](RENDERDOC-INPUTS.md). For acceptance use equivalent Frozen **Java OpenGL** workloads and the unchanged [verification rules](RENDER-VERIFICATION.md); source and numerical tests remain supplemental.
