# Java-to-Rust migration — working record
## Objective and authority
- Complete only when Java/JVM is gone and one Rust library plus one Rust executable provide client/server modes.
- Preserve or improve behavior, visuals and performance against Frozen Java OpenGL; never alter Frozen.
- User authorizes commits/pushes to master and routine pruning. Assumptions: `ASSUMPTIONS.md`.
- Plan and acceptance: `docs/development/RUST-MIGRATION.md`; content details: `docs/development/game-model/`.
## Working state — 2026-10-08
- Migration checkout: `/home/matt/Documents/Repos/MattMC_RustMigration`, branch `migration/acceptance`, based on master `1216f0604`.
- Original `MattMC` checkout remains on `batch` at `d7ee0335d`; its prompt/progress edits and other worktrees remain separate.
- Master already owns Vulkan rendering, terrain visibility/assembly/publication, DH ledger/payloads and several world/storage kernels in Rust.
- Native block registry owns shared immutable tables; Java still defines and exports content. General gameplay, world orchestration, assets/platform startup and application lifecycle remain Java.
- Cargo currently builds a cdylib only; `app/` is empty. Rust-only application and Java removal remain outstanding.
## Milestone 0 — trustworthy verification and storage (current)
- Feature fixtures must pass Frozen; missing scenarios, manifests, RGB data or failed captures cannot pass via a historical non-regression comparison.
- Background exceptions become explicit failed steps; aggregate checks every requested step and the full lifecycle scenario set.
- FPS artifacts require complete/publishable/crash-free receipts, exact frame counts, valid timings and explicit zero VUIDs.
- `--perf` requires >=2 paired repeats across all four modes; paired average-FPS medians must reach Frozen and p99 medians must not worsen.
- Client cleanup is scoped to this invocation and checks process start identity; killed owned orphans reject acceptance.
- Completed fixture copies retire while receipts/images stay; latest successful/failed driver runs are retained, with explicit `.keep` and comparison-baseline pins.
- Bulk cleanup recovered ~295 GiB; filesystem free ~304 GiB, captures 339→62 GiB. Protected save/settings/pack hashes matched.
- Detailed receipts: original checkout `artifacts/graphics-captures/goal5/disk-cleanup-20261008/`; recovery instructions: `ARTIFACT-STORAGE.md`.
- Verification: 21 focused Python regressions pass; wiki check passes (2,470 pages/43 indexes); runtime unchanged by this milestone.
## Performance and parity evidence limits
- Latest retained candidate record: `batch2/summary.json`, runtime `d7ee0335d`, ABAB/6,000 measured frames; values in `SUMMARY.md`.
- Candidate vanilla/vanilla+DH paired average-FPS medians trail Frozen by 7.8%/8.1%; shader modes lead by 10.1%/9.3%.
- Raw benchmark receipts are missing, so recorded health/metrics are not independently re-established acceptance. Fresh full evidence is required for runtime promotion.
- Feature candidate: chest/chest-shaders/sign/trident passed; bed/banner/zombie/held-item coverage is incomplete or failed.
- Prior shield/hand attempts hit disk preflight; zombie equipment-reference processing raised an exception. Separate harness failures from renderer defects.
- Settled coast comparisons do not prove all gameplay, transitions, resource bounds, shader packs or moving terrain.
## Next ownership milestone
- Move content definitions and state construction into Rust, following Phase 2 of the existing game-model plan; shared typed IDs/tables precede their consumers.
- Keep definitions independent of rendering; render-owned model/material/tint columns retain their separate lifecycle.
- Verify all IDs/states/properties/save bytes and realistic full-client workloads against Frozen before publication.
- Subsequent milestones: world storage/simulation, behavior/components by family, remaining rendering/assets/platform/network owners, native application lifecycle, then Java/bridge/build removal.
- Renderer `batch` and ABI77 worktrees need measured integration before their runtime changes are promoted.
